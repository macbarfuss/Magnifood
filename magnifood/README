Magnifood - The food magnifier.
===============================

Elevator statement
------------------

This software is intended to be a web community. Participants can manage
ingredients of meals and for each ingredient the substances are stored. So meals
can be split up in all relevant substances to see if there are special
substances present (for allergic persons) or how much carbonhydrates are in the
meal to help a diabetic choose the right amount of insulin. The software itself
is open source and usage always is intended to be free as in free beer.

Some background
---------------

Some people in my circle of friends do have special needs to their food. Some
have diabetes and have to inject insulin for every meal, other must have gluten-
free food only. All these people need detailed information of there meals.

So they all build up their own books of recipes with special hints and calculate
the amount of carbonhydrates for each portion.

My girlfriend asked me if there is a chance to ease this up and use a software.
So I decided to take this as an private project.

Feature list:
  - Manage ingredients
  - ... a lot more
